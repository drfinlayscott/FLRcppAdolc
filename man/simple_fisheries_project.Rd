\usage{
simple_fisheries_project(flfs, flb, flsr, f, f_spwn, timesteps)
}
\arguments{
  \item{flfs}{FLFisheries (with a single FLFishery with a
  single FLCatch)}

  \item{flb}{FLBiol}

  \item{f}{List of fishing mortality FLQuant objects (only
  a list of length 1 to start with)}

  \item{f_spwn}{List of fishing timing FLQuant objects
  (only a list of length 1 to start with) - not used at the
  moment - part of the SSB calculation}

  \item{timesteps}{Continuous sequence of integers (years
  and seasons)}
}
\value{
A list of FLFisheries and FLBiol objects
}
\description{
Given FLFisheries, FLBiol, FLSR, F and f.spwn, project over
timesteps No dimension checks are made! Recruitment is
annual only. Happens at start of the year. SSB is
calculated in previous year (or years depending on
recruitment age).
